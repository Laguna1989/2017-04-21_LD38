# Ludum Dare 38
A Small World
=============

You crashed down on a foreign planet and have to survive in a friendly environment.
You need to watch on your fatigue, hunger and warmth levels. If they go down to zero, you die!

To improve your chance of survival, you can gather resources and use them to craft useful items.
Luckily you could salvage a few spare parts from your escape pod and build a small workbench.
